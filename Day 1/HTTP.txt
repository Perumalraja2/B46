HTTP :-

 * HTTP : Hypertext transfer protocol
 * It is used in client-server communication
 * By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user.

HTTP-1.1 :

 * HTTP 1.1 was created in 1997
 * Ithe usest works on the textual format.
 * There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
 * It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
 * It compresses data by itself.

HTTP-2 :-

 * The new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.
 * It works on the binary protocol.
 * It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
 * It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
 * It uses HPACK for data compression.

CONCLUSION ;

HTTP/2 differs from HTTP/1.1 in many ways, with some features providing greater levels of control that can be used to better optimize web application performance and other features simply improving upon the previous protocol. 
Now that you have gained a high-level perspective on the variations between the two protocols, you can consider how such factors as multiplexing, stream prioritization, flow control, server push, and compression in HTTP/2 will affect the changing landscape of web development.
