Objects and its internal representation in javascript


Objects are important data types in javascript. Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.). 
Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair.
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

1)Object:

*key pair value
*In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. 
*Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. 
*A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. 
*The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics
 
 \\ properties
 //  Methods

2)Creating Objects in JavaScript:
*By object literal
*By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)

3)Syntax:
  object={property1:value1,property2:value2......propertyN:valueN}

Example:

const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};


4)Accessing JavaScript Objects:

objectName.property

or

objectName[“property”]



5)JavaScript Methods

A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.



const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  id: 5566,
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};

console.log(person.fullName())
 
output: John Doe
